# Cancer-Cachexia
The myostatin/activin A/ActRIIB signalling pathway plays a significant role in promoting muscle atrophy by both inhibiting the activation of satellite cells and increasing the expression of muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases that mediate muscle degradation. 
These Mathematica scripts were developed to explore the dynamics of muscle wasting in the context of cancer cachexia, as part of the study "Mathematical model of muscle wasting in cancer cachexia" by Suzan Farhang-Sardroodi et al. (2020). For any use of these scripts, please cite the following publication: https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9072029.
