# Mathematical Model of Muscle Wasting in Cancer Cachexia

The myostatin/activin A/ActRIIB signalling pathway plays a significant role in promoting muscle atrophy by both inhibiting the activation of satellite cells and increasing the expression of muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases that mediate muscle degradation.
